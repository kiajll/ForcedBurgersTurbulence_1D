# ForcedBurgersTurbulence_1D
## Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a spectral method for solving the Forced Burgersâ€™ Equation using Fourier-Galerkin discretization and FFTW for efficient spectral transforms. The code is optimized for high-performance computing with efficient memory management.
### Equation Formulation
The Forced Burgersâ€™ Equation is a fundamental model for turbulence and nonlinear wave dynamics:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+ u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\nu \frac{\partial ^2 u}{\partial x ^2}+f(x,t)$$

where:
* $u=u(x,t)$: Velocity field,
* $\nu$: Kinematic viscosity coefficient,
* $f(x,t)$: External forcing term.
This equation is solved in a periodic domain $x \in [0,L]$ , using spectral methods.
## Numerical Methods
This code uses spectral Fourier-Galerkin methods, which leverage Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) for spatial differentiation:
* Pseudo-spectral method for computing nonlinear terms.
* Explicit time integration using a third-order Runge-Kutta scheme.
* Anti-aliasing via the 3/2-rule to reduce energy pile-up at high wavenumbers.
* FFTW for efficient Fourier transforms.
### Fourier Discretization
The velocity field is represented in Fourier space as:

$$ u\left(x\right) = \sum_{k}{u_k(t)e^{ikx}} $$
